## Platform Fee Breakdown

What users think:
- 5% platform fee goes to "development and operations"

What actually happens:
- 5% collected
- 0.5% to infrastructure (AWS, etc)
- 0.3% to "community initiatives" (never seen any)
- 4.2% to "founder allocation"

## The Wallet

There's one wallet. One signer. No multisig. No DAO. No community oversight.

"Decentralized" my tentacles.

## Revenue Numbers (Q4 Estimate)

- Total platform fees collected: [REDACTED - but it's a lot more than they claim]
- Reinvested in platform: < 15%
- "Team compensation": > 80%
- Team size: 1

Do the math.

Later never came. So I'm discussing it now.
